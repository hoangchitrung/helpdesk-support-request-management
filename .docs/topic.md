## HelpDesk Support Requested Management

In organizations, technical support requests are frequently generated and must be carefully tracked to ensure timely resolution. A helpdesk system helps manage requests, assign tasks, and monitor work progress.

**Required Functions:**

1. Create support requests with content, priority level, and submission time.
2. Manage requester and support staff information.
3. Assign support requests to staff members.
4. Track request status: newly created, in progress, completed.
5. Update processing progress and maintain a history of status changes.
6. Search support requests by status or by requester.
